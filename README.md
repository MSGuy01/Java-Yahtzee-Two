# Java Yahtzee Two
This is a Yahtzee game created with Java. It is an updated version of my old Java Yahtzee game. In this version, you can play multiplayer with up to four players, or play against a computer player.
# In Progress
Certain things are still being worked on: computer AI, instructions, and credits.
# Running
Just clone/download the repository, then in command prompt navigate to the out/production/Java Yahtzee 2 folder, and run the java Menu command.
